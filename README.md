# 🎧ྀི Wrappedify 🔁
*Why wait till December when you can get your spotify wrapped right now?
This project utilizes python libraries and jupyter notebook in displaying your music taste based on your spotify streaming history.*
## How to Run
```bash
 download your spotify data
```
```bash
 into your terminal,
 git clone https://github.com/chinenyeenete/wrappedify.git
```
```bash
 upload {StreamingHistory_music_0.json}, 
        {StreamingHistory_music_1.json},
    and {StreamingHistory_podcast_0.json} into the root folder
```
```bash
 run all cells in jupyter notebook
```
*The notebook, whilst fully functional, is an idea lab + testing ground for a bigger project. Open to any suggestions on what :)*
