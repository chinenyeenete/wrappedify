## 🎧ྀི Wrappedify 🔁
*Why wait till December when you can get your spotify wrapped right now?
This project utilizes python libraries and jupyter notebook in displaying your music taste based on your spotify streaming history.*
### How to Run <br/>
```bash
 download your spotify data
```
```bash
 into your terminal,
 git clone https://github.com/chinenyeenete/wrappedify.git
```
```bash
 upload {StreamingHistory_music_0.json}, 
        {StreamingHistory_music_1.json},
    and {StreamingHistory_podcast_0.json} into the project's root folder
```
```bash
 run all cells in jupyter notebook
```
*I am planning on building an API with the notebook code as a structure, but open to other suggestions*
